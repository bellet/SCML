# Sparse-Compositional-Metric-Learning
Matlab/MEX implementation of the metric learning method proposed in our paper Sparse Compositional Metric Learning (AAAI 2014). It allows scalable learning of global, multi-task and multiple local Mahalanobis metrics for multi-class data under a unified framework based on sparse combinations of rank-one basis metrics.

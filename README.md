# Sparse Compositional Metric Learning

This is a Matlab/MEX implementation of SCML, the metric learning method proposed in our paper:
Y. Shi, A. Bellet and F. Sha.
Sparse Compositional Metric Learning.
AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2014.

SCML allows scalable learning of global, multi-task and multiple local Mahalanobis metrics for multi-class data under a unified framework based on sparse combinations of rank-one basis metrics. Distributed under GNU/GPL 3 license.
